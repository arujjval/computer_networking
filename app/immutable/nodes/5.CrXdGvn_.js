This server acts as an intermediary,  forwarding your email to the recipient's SMTP server. If both sender and recipient use the same email provider, the email is transferred directly, bypassing the intermediary server."},{title:"receiving an email",content:`To receive emails, you can leverage POP3 or IMAP. POP3 retrieves emails from the POP server to your email client and can then erase them from the server. IMAP, on the other hand, stores your emails on the server and keeps them synced across all your devices, allowing you to view and manage them from any device.
